Therefore, we load and analyze a few file types. The files describe geohydrologic datasets for an area in the town of Abbeyfeale, Ireland. For this area we will develop a simple groundwater model using Python. Therefore, we start a command prompt for Python. From that command prompt you will run 7 prepared Python scripts. Each script handles a single step in the MODFLOW 6 modelling process: the preprocessing of basic data, the creation of MODFLOW 6 input files, running of the MODFLOW6 model and analyzing the results. The files created with each step are analyzed in QGIS.\n\n\nIntroduction: schematization ground water model Abbeyfeale\nAbbeyfeale is a historic market town in the County Limerick, Ireland. The local authorities are worried about the effects of drier summers on groundwater levels. A simple groundwater model can provide them with a quantification of the expected groundwater level decline. Geology: much of Ireland can be considered as relatively glacial subsoil (typically < 15 m thick) overlying very hard old fractured rock. For basic models this can be represented as one layer for the subsoil and one layer for bedrock.\n\n\n\nVillage of Abbeyfeale and the components of the simplified Abbeyfeale model\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n\nLaunch QGIS from your START menu, your desktop or click on …\\QGIS3.24.0\\bin\\qgis-bin.exe.\n\n\n\nIntermezzo QGIS language Perhaps your QGIS was installed in another language than English. Because the Tutorial refers to the English version, let’s change than to English.\n\n\n\nFrom the main menu click on Settings and select Options. (e.g. in Dutch Extra and Opties)\nIn the new window go to the General section on the left.\nFrom the drop-down menu “User interface translation” select American English and click on OK.\nClose QGIS and open it again to activate your language change.\n\n\n\nWe start with the creation of a new QGIS project.\n\nFrom the main menu click on Project and select New.\n\nThe data we use in this part of the training is from Ireland, so next we select the appropriate projection.\n\nFrom the main menu click on Project and select Properties.\nIn the Properties window select the category CRS, search for “EPSG:2157” and you find “IRENET95 / Irish Transverse Mercator”. Select this option and click the Apply button, followed by the OK button to close the window.\n\nFor navigation purposes, let us load the universal topography of Open Street Map (OSM)\n\nCheck on the left site if the panel “Browser” is available. If not, select View from the main menu, go to Panels and select Browser Panel.\nThe Browser panel contains the group XYZ Tiles. From that group double click on the item OpenStreetMap. This layer is now added to the panel Layers. To display this dataset an internet connection is needed. So if that is the situation, you will see the world map in the display.\n\nLet us now open a series of basic files in QGIS. We start with a digital elevation map.\n\nGo to Layer in the main menu, select Add Layer and pick the option Add Raster Layer.\nIn the section Source click on the  button and select the file “…\\abbeyfeale\\data\\1-external\\topography\\Abbeyfeale DTM.tif”. GeoTIFF is a common file format.\nClick the Add button and the layer is added to the panel Layers.\nClick Close to leave the window.\nIn the panel Layers select the layer “Abbeyfeale DTM” and click the  button to zoom in to the layer.\n\nWe see the contours of a river, but the legend is gray only by default. Let’s change that.\n\nDouble click on the layer “Abbeyfeale DTM”. The window “Layer Properties” opens.\nSelect the group Symbology.\nFrom the dropdown Render Type select the type Singleband pseudocolor.\nBe sure a Color Ramp is selected as well.\nMake sure the dropdown menu Interpolation shows Linear and the dropdown menu Mode shows Continuous.\nClick Apply to change the colors and OK to close the window.\nYou can zoom in and out with the scroll button on your mouse or navigate with the buttons in the main menu: \n\nYour screen might look like Figure 1\n\n\n\nFigure 1: DTM in QGIS with the topography of OpenStreetMap Cross as background\n\n\nLet us save this project to be able to return to is later or in case of a crash of QGIS.\n\nGo to Project in the main menu, select Save As and select a folder and a file name for your project, e.g. “…\\abbeyfeale\\tutorial1.qgz”\n\nDo you like to see the values of the DTM under you mouse? You need a QGIS plugin “Value Tool”. Many additional helpful tools are available as QGIS plugin, just like our iMOD Plugin.\n\nGo to Plugins from the main menu and select Manage and Install Plugins…  and a window opens.\nOn the left, select the group All to see all available plugins.\nSearch for “iMOD” and see that the iMOD plugin is successfully installed.\nCheck if version 0.2.2 is installed. If not, click the button to Upgrade the iMOD Plugin.\nSearch for “Value Tool”, install it and Close the Plugins window.\n\nThe tool is now visible as a panel on the left and as the Value Tool button () in a panel on the top of QGIS.\n\nHover over the DTM and in the “Value Tool” panel you see the value at your mouse location.\n\nNext step is to load a polygon file representing the recharge zones in the project area.\n\nGo to Layer in the main menu, select Add Layer and pick the option Add Vector Layer.\nIn the section Source click on the  button and select the file “abbeyfeale\\data\\1-external\\recharge\\clipped_recharge.shp”. The ESRI Shapefile is a common file format.\nClick the Add button and the layer is added to the panel Layers.\nClick Close to leave the window.\n\nWe see the contours of zones with a single color. Let’s change that.\n\nDouble click on the layer “clipped_recharge”. The window “Layer Properties” opens.\nSelect the group Symbology.\nFrom the upper dropdown menu select Categorized. From the dropdown Value select RECH_MM_YR and from the dropdown Color ramp select Viridis. Click on the button Classify to create the legend.\nClick Apply to change the colors and OK to close the window.\n\nThere is also an ESRI Shapefile with the rivers in the project area. Feel free to download that file (“abbeyfeale\\data\\1-external\\rivers\\WATER_RivNetRoutes.shp”) in the same way.\nAfter loading raster and polygon layers, let us now load a point file with boreholes. This time, the file format (*.IPF) is not a common file standard but developed by Deltares because the file includes associated borelog information. We must load the IPF file with the iMOD plugin.\n\nOne of the QGIS toolbars is the iMOD Toolbar. There you find al the iMOD plugin tools. Click on the Open IPF button () and a window will open.\nClick on the  button and select the IPF “abbeyfeale\\data\\1-external\\boreholes\\BOREHOLES.IPF”.\nClick the Add button and the IPF file is added in the panel Layers.\n\nNOTE: If the points appear to be somewhere else on the map, e.g. Africa, make sure both your project and your layer have the correct CRS (EPSG:2157).\n\nCheck if the project CRS on the lower right corner still is . Otherwise double click this area and change the EPSG.\nCheck if the layer CSR is correct and therefor double click on the BOREHOLES layer.\nIn the window Layer Properties go to the section Source.\nIn the dropdown menu “Assigned Coordinate Reference System (CRS)” select EPSG:2157.\n\n\nRight-click BOREHOLES.IPF in the Layers panel and click “Show labels”. This will label the points with the borelog identifier.\n\nThe bore log for each borehole can only be displayed in a cross-section. Therefore, we activate the iMOD cross-section tool.\n\nOn the iMOD Toolbar select the Cross section button () to start the iMOD Cross Section tool. In the empty cross-section we can add a selection of (geological) layers. For now, we only select the boreholes\nClick on the button Select location and draw your cross-section line from north to south over the 3 central borehole locations. Add points to the line with your left mouse button and close the line with the right button. You can remove and redraw the line by clicking the Select location button again.\nIn the field Search buffer increase the buffer along the line to 1000m. Now a yellow shade is visible around your line selecting all the available points within.\nFrom the dropdown menu on the left, select the layer BOREHOLES if not selected already. From the borelog we want to plot the variable LITHOLOGY, which is selected already while it is the only available variable.\nClick the button Add to add this layer to the cross-section manager.\nClick the button Plot to draw this layer in the cross section.\n\nYour screen might look like Figure 2 although the colors are different than in your screen. Feel free to use the column Symbology to change the legend.\nNOTE: If no lines appear on your screen, make sure you have set your project CRS to EPSG:2157 (see earlier step).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Cross section with borelogs\n\n\nFor now, we leave QGIS and the iMOD Plugin to return later.\n\nSave your project and keep the QGIS application open.\n\n\n\niMOD Python\nThis is the moment where we start with Python. With the help of the iMOD Python package you will create a simple MODFLOW6 model and run it.\n\nAll input we use for this simple model is available in your tutorial folder “abbeyfeale\\data\\1-external\\..”. There you find the spatial data we loaded to QGIS, and there is a CSV file containing all single parameter values: “parameters.csv”.\nAll steps, from the preparation of the model input to visualization of the results, are available in separate Python scripts. You find the scripts for each phase in the folder and subfolders within “abbeyfeale\\src\\..”\n\n\nClick on the windows START button and type Deltaforge prompt. Click on the app and a black DOS window will start. [for Python experts: with this prompt a python environment is activated containing the iMOD python package as well as Snakemake (workflow manager)]\n\nFrom this DOS window we will run the different python scripts (*.py files). For the scripts to work properly, we need to navigate to the correct folder location.\n\nIn the DOS window type the letter of the drive you work on (e.g. C: or D:) and press ENTER.\nNavigate to the correct main tutorial folder with CD (change directory). E.g. “CD c:\\imod\\training\\tutorial\\abbeyfeale” and press ENTER\n\nTIP: After copying your path, you can paste your path in the prompt window with CTRL+V\nNow we run 4 scripts to convert basic data into an interim model format (NetCDF), ready to create MODFLOW6 input files. \n\nScript 1 – template\n\nThis script opens the DTM file, uses its extent for the model boundary and sets the cell size to 40m.\n\nIn the Deltaforge prompt type the command: Python src\\1-prepare\\1-create-template-grid.py and press ENTER.\n\n\nResults 1: The result is a raster file (NetCDF format) describing the mask of our model (extent and cell size) as well as our DTM scaled up to the size of the model mask.\n\nOptional step. Load the topography_raster.nc file into QGIS. The file is in the folder “Abbeyfeale\\data\\2-interim”.\n\n\nScript 2 – River\n\nThis script opens a shape file with river elements. It rasterizes it project cell size and adds a default river depth (1 m) and bottom resistance.\n\nIn the Deltaforge prompt type the command: Python src\\1-prepare\\2-create-river-system.py and press ENTER.\n\nResults 2: The result is a raster file (NetCDF format) for the river data, containing data for the parameters Stage, Bottom and Conductance.\n\nLoad the file “Abbeyfeale\\data\\2-interim\\river_raster.nc” into QGIS via the menu Layer > Add Layer > Add Raster Layer. From the interim window you see that the NC files contains 3 river parameters.\nClick on the button Add Layers and click Close to close the Data Source Manager.\n\n\nScript 3 – Recharge\n\nThis script opens the shape file with recharge zones (polygons) containing the recharge in mm per year. The recharge zones are rasterized to the project extent and cell size and the scripts adds a seasonal forcing resulting in a time series of daily recharge values for 1 year.\n\nIn the Deltaforge prompt type the command: Python src\\1-prepare\\3-create-recharge.py and press ENTER.\n\nResults 3: The result is a mesh file (NetCDF format) for the recharge data, containing data for 365 days. This NC file must be loaded as mesh in stead of a raster.\n\nFrom the menu Layer > Add layer > Add mesh load the file “Abbeyfeale\\data\\2-interim\\recharge_mesh.nc” into QGIS. From the panel Layer you can see that the file is a timeseries because a small clock symbol is visable \n\nThere are 2 ways to visualize this recharge over time: a) animation over time and b) timeseries at location.\n\nFor the animation over time, activate the Temporal Control Panel with the button  on the Map Navigation Toolbar\nFor timeseries at location activate the Timeseries panel with the Timeseries button ( ) on the iMOD Toolbar\n\nYour display should look similar with Figure 3, except for the red line below.\n\nIn the Temporal Controller panel click the green play button (). Navigation buttons appear.\nIncrease the Step from 1 to 14 days and start the animation with a click on the Play button ().\nIn the iMOD time series panel be sure the layer RECHARGE_MESH is loaded. The mesh only contains a single variable: Recharge.\nClick the button Select Points, your mouse changes into a . be sure Update on Selection is checked and hover over the mesh. The graph shows the timeseries at the location of your mouse.\nDeselect the checkbox Update on Selection.\nClick the button Select Points (your mouse becomes a  and with the left mouse button select 3 points ad random.\nFinally click the Plot button and the 3 timeseries are added to the chart. Colors can be changed.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Recharge data analysed in the Temporal Controller (QGIS) and the Time Series Plot tool (iMOD)\n\n\n\nScript 4 – Geohydrology\n\nThis script reads default parameter values from the file “parameters.csv” in order to create a NetCDF file with top and bottom of 3 layers including the geohydraulic parameters. The default values are: \n\nParemeter values\n\n\nParemeter\nValue\nQuantity\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nK_tz\n5.9\nm/d\nPermeability Transition Zone\n\n\nK_sb\n0.02\nm/d\nPermeability Shallow Bed rock\n\n\nK_db\n0.014\nm/d\nPermeability Deep Bed rock\n\n\nD_tz\n1\nm\nThickness transition zone\n\n\nD_sb\n5\nm\nThickness shallow bed rock zone\n\n\nD_db\n50\nm\nThickness deep bed rock zone\n\n\n\n\nIn the Deltaforge prompt type the command: Python src\\1-prepare\\4-create-hydrogeology.py and press ENTER.\n\nResults 4: The result is a mesh file (NetCDF format) for the geohydrological data. This NC file must be loaded as mesh instead of a raster.\n\nFrom the menu Layer > Add layer > Add mesh load the file “Abbeyfeale\\data\\2-interim\\hydrogeology_mesh.nc” into QGIS.\nDouble click on the layer name “hydrogeology_mesh” and the window Layer Properties will open.\nClick on the group Source on the left and on the right, you see all Available Datasets in this single mesh.\n\nLet’s create a cross-section with the permeability plot within each layer.\n\nFirst, we must deactivate temporal control. Open the Temporal Control Panel again (), and turn off temporal navigation with the button .\nOn the iMOD Toolbar select the  button to start the iMOD Cross Section tool.\nIn the iMOD cross-section panel be sure the layer “hydrogeology_mesh” is selected. From the Variable dropdown select permeability and from the Layers dropdown select all layers.\nClick the button Add to add this item to the list of chart elements.\nClick on the button Select Location and draw a single line over the model area with your left mouse button. Close the line with your right mouse button.\nClick the button Plot and the geology along the line colored by permeability is draw in the chart.\n\nTIP: If you do not see any line, perhaps the axes are not defined well. To view all data, click you right mouse button in the figure and select the option “View All”. The alternative is to click on the small A symbol () in the lower left of the chart.\n\nUse the scroll button on your mouse to zoom in and make the permeability of the 1st layer visible.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Three model layers coloured by permeability in the iMOD cross-section tool\n\n\n\nScript 5 – Create MODFLOW 6 input\n\nNow the input data for the model are available it is time to convert the data into the standard MODFLOW6 format. For that conversion a function exists within iMOD Python. We prepared another python script for you to easily do the conversion by running the script in the Deltaforge prompt.\n[If you are interested in the content of the script, open it in your Python editor (e.g. Spyder) or a simple Text editor].\n\nIn the Deltaforge prompt type the command: Python src\\2-build\\5-build-model.py and press ENTER.\n\nThe result of the script is a folder with the standard MODFLOW 6 input.\n\nOptional step Visit the folder “abbeyfeale\\data\\3-input” with your file manager. There your find the file MFSIM.NAM. This is the main MODFLOW6 file with references to the other files and settings. The folder GWF_1 contains the model input and later the model results.\n\n\nScript 6 – Run the MODFLOW 6 model\n\niMOD Suite uses the official USGS version of MODFLOW 6. The executable is provided with the tutorial database and is available as “abbeyfeale\\bin\\mf6.exe”.\n\nIn the Deltaforge prompt type the command: Python src\\3-model\\6-run-model.py and press ENTER.\n\nYou can check the logfile of the model in order to see if it was run successful.\nOpen the file “data\\3-input\\mf.sim.lst” in the Text Editor you prefer. Go to the end of the file and see the total run time of the model and a confirmation of a “normal termination of the simulation”.\nOpen the file “data\\3-input\\gwf_1\\gwf_1.lst”. At the end of the file you see the Volume Budgets, the water balance for the last stress period.\n\n\nScript 7 - Convert the MODFLOW 6 results for QGIS\n\nThe standard output of MODFLOW6 cannot be loaded into QGIS. Therefore, iMOD Python contains a function to convert the output into NetCDF files.\n\nIn the Deltaforge prompt type the command: Python src\\3-model\\7-post-process-output.py and press ENTER.\n\nThe result of this script is a NetCDF file with the calculated head for 365 days.\n\nLoad the file “Abbeyfeale\\data\\4-output\\hds_mesh.nc” into QGIS.\n\nBy default, the variable bottom_layer_1 is loaded. We will change the selected variable into Heads and pick a legend specific for plotting of time series.\n\nDouble click on the layer “hds_mesh” to open the Layer Properties window.\nSelect the group Source on the left and see that the mesh contains several datasets.\nSelect the group Symbology on the left and select the first tab Dataset (). Here we can select the group we want to plot, for now it is “head_layer_1”.\n\nClick on the icon () on the line for “head_layer_1” and change it into (). Click on Apply.\nSelect the second tab Contours ( ).\nSet the Min value on 40.00 and the Max value on 60.00 in order to see head changes over time.\nFrom the dropdown menu Color Ramp select Turbo and click on OK to close the window.\n\nNow we try to show an animation of the variation of calculated Heads over time and as timeseries.\n\nFor the animation over time, activate the Temporal Control Panel with the button () on the Map Navigation Toolbar\nFrom you experience with this tool, try to start the animation with timestep of 14 days.\nFor timeseries at location activate the Timeseries panel with the Timeseries button () on the iMOD Toolbar\nFrom you experience with this tool, select 3 points in the model area and plot the corresponding calculated Heads for layer 1.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Calculated head with MODFLOW 6 on 3 points within the model area\n\n\nThe QGIS part of the tutorial ends here. You can save your QGIS project now.\n\n\niMOD 3D Viewer\nLast part of the iMOD Suite tutorial we will explore the iMOD 3D Viewer. This viewer is developed while QGIS does not support 3D viewing. It can display your geological data (layers and borehole data) but also data variation through time like chloride concentrations.\nThere are 2 options to start the 3D Viewer. One option is to select layers in QGIS and select the 3D Viewer icon on the iMOD toolbar . The selected layers are opened in the 3D Viewer. The other option is to start the 3D Viewer directly. In this short Tutorial we’ll pursue the second option.\n\nLaunch the iMOD 3D Viewer from your START menu or your desktop. Search for “imod6.exe”.\nMaximize the program window for a better view.\n\nWe display some data from Brabant, a province in The Netherlands. Let’s first import an overlay file showing the surface water elements.\n\nIn the main menu choose “Data”, select “Open overlay” and open the shape file “…\\data\\1-external\\Brabant-data\\riv_brabant.shp”\nSelect the new layer in the overview and click the “draw-selected-layer” button ()\n\nNow we’ll open a dataset containing Heads calculated with a MODFLOW model. This NetCDF file contains for each model layer the top, the bottom and a timeseries of calculated heads.\n\nIn the main menu choose “Data”, select “Open grid file” and open the shape file “..\\data\\1-external\\Brabant-data\\Calculated-Heads.nc”\nSelect both layers in the overview and click the “draw-selected-layer” button ()\nClick on the “>” sign left from the layer “Calculated-Heads“ and you’ll see a subset with “All Layer” and “Layered Datasets”.\nClick on the “>” sign left from both the section “All Layer” and “Layered Datasets”.\n\nYour screen might look like Figure 6\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Top view of dataset “Calculated-Heads” and river overlay in the 3D viewer\n\n\nLet’s now experience with the viewer controls.\n\nSpin the mouse wheel forward to zoom in and spin backwards to zoom out. On a laptop, move two fingers up and down on the touchpad.\nIn case you lost control on your display view, click in the toolbar Viewer Controls on the “zoom-to-extent” button () to return to the initial view.\nCombine the Shift button + right mouse and move the camera horizontally/vertically with each mouse move (or finger on your touch pad).\nCombine the Ctrl button + right mouse and rotate the camera around its lens with a mouse move (or finger on your touch pad).\nGo back to the initial view with the “zoom-to-extent” button ().\nHold the right mouse button while moving the mouse and the camera moves around the grid.\n\nThe imported data is a nice example of an unstructured grid.\n\nZoom in to the upper left part of the grid. Notice that the grid is built from triangles, concentrated around the rivers.\nSwitch the dataset on and off with a click on the () button in file overview, left of the layer. See the underlaying rivers.\n\nIn your display the vertical thickness of the dataset is perhaps rather small. Let’s increase the vertical exaggeration.\n\nIn the upper right corner, switch off the “automatic exaggeration of the z-axis”.\nNow increase the value to 50.0 and the view will change automatically.\n\nSome final experience with the other viewer controls.\n\nUse the buttons () to reposition your camera to another fixed position to the grid.\nClick the button “Toggle Sliders”() to activate the sliders for the X, Y and Z direction.\nExperiment with the sliders, both left and right \n\nThe colors in the display by default referred to the Elevation of the layers. Let’s now color the layers by calculated Head.\n\nIn the list of imported files select “Calculated-Heads”\nFrom the subset “layered Datasets” double click on the element “data”.\n\nWait a few seconds and the name turns bold and the colors in the display change.\n\nSelect the name “data” and click your right mouse button to open a pop-up window.\nSelect “Edit legend” to open the “Legend editor” (see figure on the right).\n\nSelect PIYG for Color scale.\nCheck the Percentiles box.\nClick on OK and the window will close. The colors in your display change automatically.\n\nThe imported file doesn’t contain one single Head, but a timeseries of calculated Heads ranging from 01/01/2018 – 01/02/2018. Now let’s use the Time Slider to display the data through time. \n\nFirst click the button “Back(+y)” for a nice 3D view\nClick the button () to start the animation. It is a large dataset to the view in the display only changes slowly.\nStop the animation with the button ().\nPlay around with the slider.\n\nThat’s all for now. You can save your session if you like.\n\nFrom the main menu choose “File” and select “Save As…” to save the session as an *.imod file.\nClose the 3D viewer via menu “File” and select Quit””.\n\nThank you for your patience and attention.\n\n\n\niMOD 3D Viewer - Legend Editor"
