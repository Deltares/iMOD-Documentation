To install the iMOD Viewer components (3D Viewer & QGIS plugin),
download the installer 
`via this link <https://download.deltares.nl/en/download/imod-viewer/>`_.
If the subscription worked correctly, 
you will receive a download link via e-mail within only a few minutes.

.. warning::
    The QGIS plugin of course requires QGIS.
    You can download the standalone QGIS setup 
    `on the QGIS website <https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html>`_
    We recommend downloading a QGIS version > 3.18 here.
    After downloading the QGIS setup, run it.

Unzip the zipfile, which includes the viewer installer.
Double click the `.msi` file.

This will open up the first screen of the setup wizard.

    Installation selection type.

You can select a *Minimal* or *Complete* installation here,
by clicking the respective buttons. 

Note that the QGIS plugin, which comes only with a *Complete* install,
is required to use all features of the iMOD viewer. 
These are: 

* Drawing fence diagrams 
* Loading only a sub section of the map (useful for large files)
* Access to more legends.

After selecting the preferred installation type, 
you still have to click *Next* before installation continues.

This will open the install screen.

The installer will also create a program shortcut to the pdf with documentation.

it should pop up.
