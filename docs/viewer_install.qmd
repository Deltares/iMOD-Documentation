title: Install iMOD QGIS Plugin
number-sections: true

## Description
The different ways to install the QGIS plugin are described in
@sec-plugin_repository and @sec-manual_install. Each of
these, however, require the user to install QGIS.

## Installing QGIS {#sec-install_QGIS}

You can download the standalone QGIS setup [on the QGIS website]
(https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). We recommend downloading a
QGIS version >= 3.28 here. After downloading the QGIS setup, run it.

This installs a user installation of QGIS, which is sufficient in most cases.
For a system wide installation, see @sec-system-wide.

## Installing the iMOD QGIS plugin

The different options to install the iMOD QGIS plugin are listed below..

### (Option 1) Installing from the QGIS plugin repository (Recommended) {#sec-plugin_repository}

In QGIS, navigate to *Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins > All*. In the
search bar, type: "*iMOD*". Select the iMOD plugin, and click *"Install"*.

### (Option 2) Manually download and copy the iMOD QGIS plugin {#sec-manual_install}

Download the iMOD QGIS plugin code from the [Github
page](https://github.com/Deltares/imod-qgis]

Unpack the zip files, and copy the ``imodqgis`` folder to your QGIS plugin
directory. This is probably located in your Appdata folder. In windows it is
something such as:
``c:\Users\%USER%\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins``

If you cannot find the folder, follow [these instructions]
(https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/274312>).

In QGIS, make sure under *Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins > Installed*
that the checkbox *iMOD* is checked.

## Advanced: Installing the QGIS plugin system-wide {#sec-system-wide}

There are cases where a system-wide QGIS installation is required, for example
on computational servers, where multiple users need to use the software.
Requiring each user to install the plugin themselves can be a burden.

This requires the following steps:

1. Installing the OSGeo4W QGIS installation
2. Putting the plugin files in the right folder.

### Installing the OSGeo4W QGIS installation

- Download the OSGeo4W installer from the
  `QGIS website <https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html>`_

- Right-click ``osgeo4w-setup.exe`` and click *Run as administrator*
  
- At the starting screen, choose *Advanced Install*
  
- In the *Choose Installation Type* screen, 
  choose *Install from Internet* if you have access to the internet, 
  this will download the files to a folder called something like: 
  ``%APPDATA%\Local\Temp\http%3a%2f%2fdownload.osgeo.org%2fosgeo4w%2fv2%2f\`` 
  
  You can use this folder to *Install from Local Directory* later (for example
  on a restricted server)

- In *Choose Installation Directory* check *All Users*
  
- In "Select Local Package Directory", you can leave the default options
  
- If you previously checked "Install from Internet": 
	- in the *Select Connection Type*, choose *Direct Connection*
	- in *Choose Download Sites*, choose http://download.osgeo.org
  
- In the *Select Packages* screen, make sure the following components are installed:
	- under *Desktop*, *qgis: QGIS Desktop*.
	- under *Libs*, *python3-pandas*

  A component will be installed if there is a version number in the "New" column 
  (If *Skip* change this by clicking the cell with *Skip* in it).

- After downloading an installing, check *Finish*

::: {.callout-tip}
Maximize the screen to see the package names
:::

![The *Select packages* screen enlarged. If you click *Skip*, 
  a version number should appear in the column *New*.](figures/qgis/osgeo4w-select-packages.png)

### Putting the plugin files in the right folder

Download the iMOD QGIS plugin code from the [Github
page](https://github.com/Deltares/imod-qgis)

Unpack the zip files, and copy the ``imodqgis`` folder to your QGIS plugin
directory. This is probably located in your Appdata folder. In windows it is
something such as: ``c:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis\python\plugins\imodqgis``
