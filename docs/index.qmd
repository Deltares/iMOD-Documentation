The iMOD Suite offers different modules which support modelling with
MODFLOW 6 (including unstructured meshes):

-   iMOD QGIS plugin: The iMOD QGIS Plugin QGIS plugin allows visualisation of
    model input and output with tools for cross-sections, timeseries. It
    supports structured NetCDF, UGRID and IPF files. 
-   iMOD Python: A Python package to create large groundwater
    models for MODFLOW 6. It makes it easy to go from your raw data to a fully
    defined MODFLOW model, with the aim to make this workflow
    reproducible.
-   iMOD Coupler: Software that couples MODFLOW 6 to other computational
    cores. It currently supports a coupling to MetaSWAP and RIBASIM, and additional
    computational cores might be added in the future.
