## What's included

The iMOD Suite provides tools to efficiently build and visualize
groundwater models. 

Deltares is working to integrate and improve our groundwater software. 
Therefore iMOD is extended with a new iMOD Suite to link to the latest 
developments on the MODFLOW and on the changing requirements in the field 
of groundwatermodelling, most pressing currently the support 
of unstructured grids. 

We created the new iMOD Suite to aid pre- and post-processing
unstructured groundwater models. 
Furthermore, a second goal of this suite was to better connect to
the latest developments in the data science ecosystem, by utilizing:

- Existing data format conventions (NetCDF, UGRID) instead of 
  developing new ones, allowing more user flexibility to find the right
  tools for the right job.
- Widely used and tested software (QGIS) to which we add our extension, 
  instead of creating complete programs ourselves.
- Modern programming languages (C++ and Python) that 
  allow connecting to a big and lively software ecoystem.

The iMOD Suite offers different modules which support 
modelling with MODFLOW 6 (including unstructured meshes):

1. **iMOD Viewer**: The iMOD Viewer consist of a standalone 3D viewer and a
QGIS plugin. The [iMOD QGIS Plugin](qgis_user_manual.qmd) allows visualisation
of model input and output with tools for cross-sections, timeseries and link to
the 3D viewer. It supports structured NetCDF, UGRID and IPF files. And the
[iMOD 3D Viewer](3dviewer_user_manual.qmd) for interactive 3D visualisation of
unstructured input and output. Supports UGRID file format and IPF borelog
files.

1. **iMOD Python**: A Python package to support MODFLOW groundwater
modeling. It makes it easy to go from your raw data to a fully defined MODFLOW
model, with the aim to make this workflow reproducable. 

1. **iMOD Coupler**: Software that couples MODFLOW 6 to other computational
cores. It currently supports a coupling to MetaSWAP, but additional
computational cores are planned in the future.

## Comparison with iMOD 5

The proven technology and expertise of iMOD is consolidated within iMOD 5. iMOD
5 supports structured calculations with MODFLOW2005 and structured MODFLOW 6
and can be coupled to the unsaturated zone model MetaSWAP. The model input and
output can be visualised in its fast interactive viewer. [The documentation of
iMOD 5 can be found here](https://oss.deltares.nl/web/imod) .

Important technological innovations will be developed in the new iMOD Suite,
whereas iMOD 5 will be maintained the coming years, but will see no big new
feature developments. @tbl-iMOD-comparison and @tbl-iMOD-comparison-2
respectively provide comparisons between iMOD Suite and iMOD 5 for the
components and supported MODFLOW6 packages.
