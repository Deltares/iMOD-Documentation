## Trainings

### Delft Software Days

Twice a year, there is an iMOD day, where users can hear the latest iMOD
developments and get training in the latest features. These are a great
opportunity to get to know fellow users and the developers. Trainings will be
announced on the [Delft Software Days
website](https://softwaredays.deltares.nl/) and via the iMOD mailing list, so
keep an eye out on those.

In 2021, the Delft Software Days were not held in person but recorded as
webinars, which can be viewed online. Note that due to privacy seetings, you
might need follow the link below the video to view it on the Deltares Vimeo
page.

## History

Developments on iMOD started in 2006, with the aim to make groundwater
modelling with MODFLOW easier. iMOD developed into a full fletched GUI, which
could be used to build and analyse groundwater models from start to finish.
Focus of the software always has been on large groundwater models, for which
the software was so succesful that most regional groundwater models owned by
water boards in Netherlands, plus the Dutch National model (LHM), run on iMOD.
In 2014, in Deltares' move to make their software open source, the Fortran code
of iMOD was shared and in 2015 the compiled executables became freely
available. iMOD's capabilities of simulating large groundwater models were
pushed further in 2017 when iMOD and its custom computational kernels iMODFLOW
and iMOD-WQ, could be run in parallel. Developments on the GUI continued up to
2020, when it became apparent that the approach up to that point had a few
drawbacks:

- With the release of Modflow 6, computations on unstructured grids were
possible. This created a demand for supporting all types of unstructured grids.
iMOD, however, could not support these grids (except multi-model structured
subgrids).

- It was difficult to connect iMOD to the ever changing software and data
science ecosystem, because of the use of Fortran and iMOD's custom data formats.
For example, Python has a larger ecosystem, allowing users to easily
incorporate all kinds of packages into their workflows.

Therefore, in 2021, the iMOD Suite was released, consisting of a Python
package, a QGIS plugin, and a 3D viewer, which support reproducible workflows
for unstructured groundwater models and relies more on standard filetypes such
as NetCDF, UGRID, and shapefiles.

The classic GUI is consolidated under the name iMOD 5, and will be maintained
for the coming years.
