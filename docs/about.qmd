## History

Developments on iMOD started in 2006, with the aim to make groundwater
modelling with MODFLOW easier. iMOD developed into a full fletched GUI, which
could be used to build and analyse groundwater models from start to finish.
Focus of the software always has been on large groundwater models, for which
the software was so succesful that most regional groundwater models owned by
water boards in Netherlands, plus the Dutch National model (LHM), run on iMOD.
In 2014, in Deltares' move to make their software open source, the Fortran code
of iMOD was shared and in 2015 the compiled executables became freely
available. In many international projects (for example in India, New Orleans,
Colombia, Germany, and Switzerland) this was one of the reasons to adopt iMOD
as the modelling software. iMOD's capabilities of simulating large groundwater
models were pushed further in 2017 when iMOD and its custom computational
kernels iMODFLOW and iMOD-WQ, could be run in parallel. Developments on the GUI
continued up to 2020, when it became apparent that the approach up to that
point had a few drawbacks:

- With the release of Modflow 6, computations on unstructured grids were
possible. This created a demand for supporting all types of unstructured grids.
iMOD, however, could not support these grids (except multi-model structured
subgrids).

- It was difficult to connect iMOD to the ever changing software and data
science ecosystem, because of the use of Fortran and iMOD's custom data formats.
For example, Python has a larger ecosystem, allowing users to easily
incorporate all kinds of packages into their workflows.

Therefore, in 2021, the **iMOD Suite** was released. This suite consists of a
Python package, a QGIS plugin, and a 3D viewer. It therefore supports
reproducible workflows for unstructured groundwater models and relies more on
standard filetypes such as NetCDF, UGRID, and shapefiles.

The classic iMOD GUI and its batch functionality is consolidated under the name
**iMOD 5**, and will be maintained for the coming years. During this transition
period it is easy to use iMOD 5 in combination with iMOD Suite. New
developments will land in iMOD Suite.

## Trainings

### Delft Software Days

Twice a year, there is an iMOD day, where users can hear the latest iMOD
developments and get training in the latest features. These are a great
opportunity to get to know fellow users and the developers. Trainings will be
announced on the [Delft Software Days
website](https://softwaredays.deltares.nl/) and via the iMOD mailing list, so
keep an eye out on those.

In 2021, the Delft Software Days were not held in person but recorded as
webinars, which can be viewed online. Note that due to privacy seetings, you
might need follow the link below the video to view it on the Deltares Vimeo
page.
