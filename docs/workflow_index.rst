******************
Example workflows
******************

The iMOD-suite consists of several components, and combining these in different ways allows for different workflows.
This "mix-and-match" capability benefits user flexibility, but it can be a bit daunting at start.

Therefore, we have compiled a set of example workflows to help you get started and 
give you an overview of the Suite's capabilities.

**Examples:**
