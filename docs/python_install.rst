For an explanation how to best install iMOD Python, 
see the documentation here:
https://imod.xyz/installation.html

iMOD Python has no point release schedule, but instead has a "rolling release", 
where the package is frequently updated.
Therefore we advice doing a 
`development install. <https://www.imod.xyz/installation.html#installing-a-newer-or-old-version>`_
