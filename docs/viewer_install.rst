    Installation selection type.

You can select a *Minimal* or *Complete* installation here,
by clicking the respective buttons. 

Note that the QGIS plugin, which comes only with a *Complete* install,
is required to use all features of the iMOD viewer. 
These are: 

* Drawing fence diagrams 
* Loading only a sub section of the map (useful for large files)
* Access to more legends.

After selecting the preferred installation type, 
you still have to click *Next* before installation continues.

This will open the install screen.
