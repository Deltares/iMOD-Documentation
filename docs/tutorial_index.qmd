The iMOD-suite consists of several components, and combining these in different
ways allows for different workflows. This "mix-and-match" capability benefits
user flexibility, but it can be a bit daunting at start.

Therefore, we have compiled a set of tutorials to help you get started and give
you an overview of the Suite's capabilities.

To download and install the iMOD Suite, [follow the instructions
here](https://deltares.github.io/iMOD-Documentation/viewer_install.html). To
download the tutorial material, you can [follow this
