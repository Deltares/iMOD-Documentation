Apparently we can link the Powershell logo on our our documentation:

Your computer might throw you the following error in Windows PowerShell.
This is annoying, because it prevents the Visual Studio Code terminal
(which uses PowerShell) to use conda.

``` console
File C:\Users\Herman\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\profile.ps1 cannot be loaded because the
execution of scripts is disabled on this system. Please see "get-help about_signing" for
more details.
At line:1 char:2
+ . <<<<  'C:\Users\Herman\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\profile.ps1'
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [], PSSecurityException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : RuntimeException
```

In order to solve this, it is recommended to run the following command:

``` console
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
