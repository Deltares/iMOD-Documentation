## Introduction

Known issues with the iMOD Viewer are listed over here.

## QGIS plugin

### Plot axis off

In the QGIS plugin, a weird offset in the plot axis can occur when you
use a multiple monitor setup. Both the Time series widget as well as the
Cross-section widget can suffer from this.

![Notice the y-axis being moved too high and the x-axis being scaled
weirdly.](figures/qgis_issues/plot_axis_offset.png)

So far we haven\'t been able to fix it in the code, so you can fix this
as a user by either:

-   Moving your QGIS application to the **main window** of your monitor
    setup
-   In Windows, navigate to *Settings \> Display* then under *Rearrange
    your displays* select the monitor you want to view QGIS on, and
    finally tick the box *Make this my main display*

### IPF reader does not support all IPF files

Currently the IPF reader is not able to read every IPF file, as iMOD 5 supports
quite a wide range of IPF files. For example, iMOD 5 supports both whitespace
and comma separated files, whereas the QGIS plugin only supports comma
separated IPF files. If the plugin is unable to read your IPF file, it is best
to [read the file with iMOD
Python](https://deltares.github.io/imod-python/api/generated/io/imod.formats.ipf.read.html)
and consequently [write it
again](https://deltares.github.io/imod-python/api/generated/io/imod.formats.ipf.write.htm).
This can help, because the IPF reader in iMOD Python is a lot more flexible,
but its writer always writes to a specific format. We plan to improve the
flexibility of the plugin\'s IPF reader.
