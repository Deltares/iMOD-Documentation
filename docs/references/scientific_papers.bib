abstract = {Freshwater availability in the coastal zone is threatened by overexploitation, seawater intrusion and global change. Recent advances in parallel computing of coupled variable-density groundwater flow and salt transport models enables the construction of large-scale high-resolution models, key to support sound policy making. Here, we present the construction of a nationwide coupled variable-density groundwater flow and salt transport model for the Netherlands, derived from the existing nationwide groundwater flow model. Construction of the model is fully scripted in a reproducible and transparent version-controlled workflow, aiding regular updating and stakeholder trust in model results. A 3D groundwater salinity distribution was interpolated from over 2M available measurements using Multiple Indicator Kriging as a starting condition in the model. Calculation of a high-end sea-level rise scenario shows the added benefit of large-scale groundwater salinity modelling for policy making. The presented approach is generally applicable to groundwater flow models of coastal aquifers.}

abstract = {Freshwater aquifers in low elevation coastal zones are known to be threatened by saltwater intrusion (SWI). As these areas host a significant share of the world's population, an excellent understanding of this phenomenon is required to effectively manage the availability of freshwater. SWI is a dynamic process, therefore saline groundwater distributions can change quickly over time – particularly in stressed areas with anthropogenic drivers. To model these changes, regional 3D variable-density groundwater (3D-VDG) flow and coupled salt transport models are often used to estimate the current (and future distributions) of saline groundwater. Unfortunately, parameterising 3D-VDG models is a challenging task with many uncertainties. Generally, uncertainty is reduced through the addition of observational data – such as Airborne Electromagnetic (AEM) surveys or ground-based information – that offer information about parameters such as salinity and hydraulic head. Recent research has shown the ability of AEM surveys to provide accurate 3D groundwater salinity models across regional scales, as well as highlighting the potential for good survey repeatability. To this end we investigated the novel approach of using repeat AEM surveys (flown over the same area at different points in time) and 3D-VDG models to jointly improve the parameterisation of 3D-VDG models - while simultaneously providing a detailed 3D map of groundwater salinity distributions. Using detailed 3D synthetic models, the results of this study quantitatively highlight the usefulness of this approach, while offering practical information on implementation and further research.},

abstract = {Most river deltas are densely populated areas with intensive agriculture. The increased shortage of fresh surface water that results from rising demands are expected to lead to increased groundwater pumping, which leads to sea water intrusion. To correctly project the future of fresh groundwater resources in deltas, knowing the current fresh-salt groundwater distribution is a prerequisite. However, uncertainties about these distributions and their drivers are large. To understand these uncertainties, we conducted a global sensitivity analysis of a complex three-dimensional variable-density groundwater model of a synthetic delta, simulating the effect of the last glacial low stand and the subsequent marine transgression. The analysis is unique in its wide range of geometries, hydrogeological parameterizations, and boundary conditions analyzed, making it representative for a large number of deltas worldwide. We find that the aquifer hydraulic conductivity is the most uncertain input and has a strong nonmonotonous effect on the total salt mass onshore. The calculated fresh-salt groundwater distributions were classified into five classes and compared to real-world case studies. We find that salinity inversions occur in deltaic systems with high representative system anisotropies as a remnant of a marine transgression. These salinity inversions were observed in half of the real-world cases, indicating that their fresh-salt groundwater distributions are not in a dynamic equilibrium. We conclude that it is very likely that past marine transgressions are still reflected in the current fresh-salt groundwater distributions in deltas. This makes paleo-groundwater modeling a prerequisite for effective simulation of present-day groundwater salinity distributions in these systems.},

abstract = {Population growth, urbanization and intensification of irrigated agriculture in the world's deltas boost the demand for fresh water, with extensive groundwater extraction as a result. This, in turn, leads to salt water intrusion and upconing, which poses a threat to freshwater and food security. Managing fresh groundwater resources in deltas requires accurate knowledge about the current status and behaviour of their fresh groundwater resources. However, this knowledge is scarcely present, especially for groundwater at larger depths. Here, we use three-dimensional variable-density groundwater model simulations over the last 125 ka to estimate the volume of fresh groundwater resources for 15 major deltas around the world. We estimate current volumes of onshore fresh groundwater resources for individual deltas to vary between 10 10 m 3 and 10 12 m 3 . Offshore, the estimated volumes of fresh groundwater are generally smaller, though with a considerably higher variability. In 9 out of 15 simulated deltas, fresh groundwater volumes developed over thousands of years. Based on current groundwater extraction and recharge rates, we estimate the time until in-situ fresh groundwater resources are completely exhausted, partly leading to groundwater level decline and mostly replacement with river water or saline groundwater. This straightforward analysis shows that 4 out of 15 deltas risk complete exhaustion of fresh groundwater resources within 300 m depth in 200 years. These deltas also suffer from saline surface water which means their groundwater resources will progressively salinize. With a fourfold increase in extraction rates, seven deltas risk a complete exhaustion within 200 years. Of these seven deltas, six suffer from saline surface water. We stress that the groundwater of these six vulnerable deltas should be carefully managed, to avoid non-renewable groundwater use. The progressive exhaustion of fresh groundwater resources in these deltas will hamper their ability to withstand periods of water scarcity.},

abstract = {Abstract. The Nile Delta is an important agricultural area with a fast-growing population. Though traditionally irrigated with surface water, the delta increasingly relies on groundwater. However, saline groundwater extends far land inward, rendering groundwater close to the coastal zone useless for consumption or agriculture. To aid groundwater management decisions, hydrogeologists reconstructed this saline and brackish groundwater zone using variable-density groundwater models with very large dispersivities. However, this approach cannot explain the observed freshening of this zone as observed by hydrogeochemists, who hypothesize that the coastal saline zone is the effect of the Holocene transgression. Here, we investigated physical plausibility of this hypothesis by conducting a palaeo-reconstruction of groundwater salinity for the last 32&thinsp;ka with a complex 3D variable-density groundwater flow model, using state-of-the-art model code that allows for parallel computation. Several scenarios with different lithologies and hypersaline groundwater provenances were simulated, of which five were selected that showed the best match with the observations. Amongst these selections, total fresh water volumes varied strongly, ranging from 1526 to 2659&thinsp;km3, mainly due to uncertainties in the lithology offshore and at larger depths. This range is smaller (1511&ndash;1989&thinsp;km3) when we consider the volumes of onshore fresh groundwater within 300&thinsp;m depth. Regardless of the variance, in all cases the total volume of hypersaline groundwater exceeded that of sea water. We also show that during the last 32&thinsp;ka, the total fresh groundwater volumes significantly declined, with a factor ranging from 1.9 to 5.4, due to the rising sea-level. Compared to a steady-state solution with present-day boundary conditions, the palaeo-reconstruction improved our validation for the saline zone (5&thinsp;g/L&ndash;35&thinsp;g/L TDS). Also, under highly permeable conditions the marine transgression simulated with the palaeo-reconstruction led to a steeper fresh-salt interface compared to its steady-state equivalent, while low permeable clay layers allowed for the preservation of volumes of fresh groundwater. This shows that long-term transient simulations are needed when estimating present-day fresh-salt groundwater distribution in large deltas. The insights of this study are also applicable to other major deltaic areas, given the wide-range of lithological model scenarios used in this study and since many deltas also experienced a Holocene marine transgression.},

abstract = {Abstract Groundwater abstraction and drainage are considered to be main drivers for salinization of low-lying coastal groundwater systems, while the role of past boundary conditions is less clear. In this study, 3-D paleo-hydrogeological variable-density groundwater flow and salt transport modeling (‘paleo-modeling’) is applied to reconstruct the evolution of groundwater salinities during the Holocene, i.e., the last 9000 years, in Northwestern Germany. Novel aspects of this study include the consideration of highly resolved time-variant boundary conditions in a 3-D paleo-modeling framework, e.g., sea-level rise, surface elevation and coastline changes, development of drainage networks and groundwater abstraction, as well as the quantification of isolated processes impacting salinization. Results show that salinization was a function of sea-level rise from 9000 BP until 1300 AD. The creation of the dike line ∼1300 AD set the starting point for increasing anthropogenic control of the hydro(geo)logical system: changes in surface elevation and drainage of low-lying marshes have become main drivers for salinization after 1600 AD, when peat was artificially degenerated. Moreover, changes of the dike line caused by storm floods impacted the salinities. Model results for 2020 AD match well with present-day salinity observations. Yet, salinization will continue in the future, as the hydro(geo)logical system has not reached an equilibrium. The presented paleo-modeling framework can be viewed as blueprint for similar low-lying coastal groundwater systems, influenced by marine transgression and human development. Thereby, it enables the reconstruction of meaningful present-day salinity distributions, serving as vital basis for modeling of future groundwater systems in a changing climate.

abstract = {Offshore freshened groundwater (OFG) has been encountered in continental margins around the world and identified as a potential unconventional water resource. In China, coastal areas and islands face limited freshwater resources. The East China Sea, specifically the region north of Shengsi islands, may contain an OFG system hosted in buried paleochannels associated with the ancient Yangtze river. To assess the OFG potential, characteristics, and controls in this region, we employed an integrated modeling approach. We constructed a 2D geological model of Quaternary sediments based on data from two well sites. By considering sea-level fluctuations over the past 200,000 years, we conducted a paleo-reconstruction of groundwater flow and solute transport conditions on the 2D transect. We compared the simulated present-day distribution of OFG in the model with borehole observations. Our findings indicate that the region was mostly sub-aerially exposed during the simulated period, allowing for potential meteoric recharge. Numerical results demonstrate a high likelihood of a laterally extensive OFG system existing today. The mechanism responsible for its formation appears to be meteoric recharge and offshore directed groundwater flow caused by increased hydraulic gradients during sea-level lowstand. The model suggests that the OFG system forms an oceanward dipping wedge, with the top occurring approximately 50–100 m below the seafloor. Freshwater is likely present down to the basement at around 250 m. The geometry and volume of the OFG system are strongly influenced by the shelf stratigraphy. We estimate the volume of freshwater in the region to range from 0.5 to 1.6 km<sup>3</sup> km<sup>-1</sup>, indicating a viable potential freshwater resource for the Shengsi region and coastal city of Shanghai. To gain further insights, we recommend conducting additional investigations using geophysical techniques.}

   abstract = {Coastal fresh groundwaters face growing threats from rising withdrawals and climate change, with salinization of surface and groundwater as notable impacts. Recent developments in parallel variable-density modelling enable studying these threats at unexplored resolutions and extents. To improve the understanding of ground- and surface water salinization processes, we designed an experiment to measure how spatial resolution affects both groundwater salinity distribution and salt loads to surface waters. An existing parallelized coupled variable-density groundwater flow and salt transport (VD-GWT) model is applied to a region in the Netherlands whereby the surface water drainage network is parameterized at grid resolutions between 10 and 250 m. The results show a strong dependency between resolution and the salinity distribution in shallow groundwater while simulated salt loads are affected by imperfect flux scaling. The computational resources needed for this test suggest that regional high-resolution VD-GWT models are feasible using HPC environments, albeit not practical.},

   abstract = {Fresh coastal groundwater is a valuable water resource of global significance, but its quality is threatened by saltwater intrusion. Excessive groundwater abstraction, sea-level rise (SLR), land subsidence and other climate-related factors are expected to accelerate this process in the future. The objective of this study is to (a) quantify the impact of projected climate change and (b) explore the role of individual hydrogeological boundaries on groundwater salinization of low-lying coastal groundwater systems until 2100 CE. We employ numerical density-dependent groundwater flow and salt transport modeling for this purpose, using Northwestern Germany as a case. Separate model variants are constructed and forced with climate data, that is, projected SLR and groundwater recharge, as well as likely ranges of other hydrogeological boundaries, including land subsidence, abstraction rates and drain levels. We find that autonomous salinization in the marsh areas, resulting from non-equilibrium of the present-day groundwater salinity distribution with current boundary conditions, is responsible for >50% of the salinization increase until 2100 CE. Sea-level rise, land subsidence and drain levels are the other major factors controlling salinization. We further show that salinization of the water resources is a potential threat to coastal water users, including water suppliers and the agrarian sector, as well as coastal ecosystems. Regional-scale uplifting of drain levels is identified as an efficient measure to mitigate salinization of deep and shallow groundwater in the future. The presented modeling approach highlights the consequences of climate change and anthropogenic impacts for coastal salinization, supporting the timely development of mitigation strategies.},
