abstract = {Freshwater availability in the coastal zone is threatened by overexploitation, seawater intrusion and global change. Recent advances in parallel computing of coupled variable-density groundwater flow and salt transport models enables the construction of large-scale high-resolution models, key to support sound policy making. Here, we present the construction of a nationwide coupled variable-density groundwater flow and salt transport model for the Netherlands, derived from the existing nationwide groundwater flow model. Construction of the model is fully scripted in a reproducible and transparent version-controlled workflow, aiding regular updating and stakeholder trust in model results. A 3D groundwater salinity distribution was interpolated from over 2M available measurements using Multiple Indicator Kriging as a starting condition in the model. Calculation of a high-end sea-level rise scenario shows the added benefit of large-scale groundwater salinity modelling for policy making. The presented approach is generally applicable to groundwater flow models of coastal aquifers.}

abstract = {Freshwater aquifers in low elevation coastal zones are known to be threatened by saltwater intrusion (SWI). As these areas host a significant share of the world's population, an excellent understanding of this phenomenon is required to effectively manage the availability of freshwater. SWI is a dynamic process, therefore saline groundwater distributions can change quickly over time – particularly in stressed areas with anthropogenic drivers. To model these changes, regional 3D variable-density groundwater (3D-VDG) flow and coupled salt transport models are often used to estimate the current (and future distributions) of saline groundwater. Unfortunately, parameterising 3D-VDG models is a challenging task with many uncertainties. Generally, uncertainty is reduced through the addition of observational data – such as Airborne Electromagnetic (AEM) surveys or ground-based information – that offer information about parameters such as salinity and hydraulic head. Recent research has shown the ability of AEM surveys to provide accurate 3D groundwater salinity models across regional scales, as well as highlighting the potential for good survey repeatability. To this end we investigated the novel approach of using repeat AEM surveys (flown over the same area at different points in time) and 3D-VDG models to jointly improve the parameterisation of 3D-VDG models - while simultaneously providing a detailed 3D map of groundwater salinity distributions. Using detailed 3D synthetic models, the results of this study quantitatively highlight the usefulness of this approach, while offering practical information on implementation and further research.},

abstract = {Most river deltas are densely populated areas with intensive agriculture. The increased shortage of fresh surface water that results from rising demands are expected to lead to increased groundwater pumping, which leads to sea water intrusion. To correctly project the future of fresh groundwater resources in deltas, knowing the current fresh-salt groundwater distribution is a prerequisite. However, uncertainties about these distributions and their drivers are large. To understand these uncertainties, we conducted a global sensitivity analysis of a complex three-dimensional variable-density groundwater model of a synthetic delta, simulating the effect of the last glacial low stand and the subsequent marine transgression. The analysis is unique in its wide range of geometries, hydrogeological parameterizations, and boundary conditions analyzed, making it representative for a large number of deltas worldwide. We find that the aquifer hydraulic conductivity is the most uncertain input and has a strong nonmonotonous effect on the total salt mass onshore. The calculated fresh-salt groundwater distributions were classified into five classes and compared to real-world case studies. We find that salinity inversions occur in deltaic systems with high representative system anisotropies as a remnant of a marine transgression. These salinity inversions were observed in half of the real-world cases, indicating that their fresh-salt groundwater distributions are not in a dynamic equilibrium. We conclude that it is very likely that past marine transgressions are still reflected in the current fresh-salt groundwater distributions in deltas. This makes paleo-groundwater modeling a prerequisite for effective simulation of present-day groundwater salinity distributions in these systems.},

abstract = {Population growth, urbanization and intensification of irrigated agriculture in the world's deltas boost the demand for fresh water, with extensive groundwater extraction as a result. This, in turn, leads to salt water intrusion and upconing, which poses a threat to freshwater and food security. Managing fresh groundwater resources in deltas requires accurate knowledge about the current status and behaviour of their fresh groundwater resources. However, this knowledge is scarcely present, especially for groundwater at larger depths. Here, we use three-dimensional variable-density groundwater model simulations over the last 125 ka to estimate the volume of fresh groundwater resources for 15 major deltas around the world. We estimate current volumes of onshore fresh groundwater resources for individual deltas to vary between 10 10 m 3 and 10 12 m 3 . Offshore, the estimated volumes of fresh groundwater are generally smaller, though with a considerably higher variability. In 9 out of 15 simulated deltas, fresh groundwater volumes developed over thousands of years. Based on current groundwater extraction and recharge rates, we estimate the time until in-situ fresh groundwater resources are completely exhausted, partly leading to groundwater level decline and mostly replacement with river water or saline groundwater. This straightforward analysis shows that 4 out of 15 deltas risk complete exhaustion of fresh groundwater resources within 300 m depth in 200 years. These deltas also suffer from saline surface water which means their groundwater resources will progressively salinize. With a fourfold increase in extraction rates, seven deltas risk a complete exhaustion within 200 years. Of these seven deltas, six suffer from saline surface water. We stress that the groundwater of these six vulnerable deltas should be carefully managed, to avoid non-renewable groundwater use. The progressive exhaustion of fresh groundwater resources in these deltas will hamper their ability to withstand periods of water scarcity.},

abstract = {Abstract. The Nile Delta is an important agricultural area with a fast-growing population. Though traditionally irrigated with surface water, the delta increasingly relies on groundwater. However, saline groundwater extends far land inward, rendering groundwater close to the coastal zone useless for consumption or agriculture. To aid groundwater management decisions, hydrogeologists reconstructed this saline and brackish groundwater zone using variable-density groundwater models with very large dispersivities. However, this approach cannot explain the observed freshening of this zone as observed by hydrogeochemists, who hypothesize that the coastal saline zone is the effect of the Holocene transgression. Here, we investigated physical plausibility of this hypothesis by conducting a palaeo-reconstruction of groundwater salinity for the last 32&thinsp;ka with a complex 3D variable-density groundwater flow model, using state-of-the-art model code that allows for parallel computation. Several scenarios with different lithologies and hypersaline groundwater provenances were simulated, of which five were selected that showed the best match with the observations. Amongst these selections, total fresh water volumes varied strongly, ranging from 1526 to 2659&thinsp;km3, mainly due to uncertainties in the lithology offshore and at larger depths. This range is smaller (1511&ndash;1989&thinsp;km3) when we consider the volumes of onshore fresh groundwater within 300&thinsp;m depth. Regardless of the variance, in all cases the total volume of hypersaline groundwater exceeded that of sea water. We also show that during the last 32&thinsp;ka, the total fresh groundwater volumes significantly declined, with a factor ranging from 1.9 to 5.4, due to the rising sea-level. Compared to a steady-state solution with present-day boundary conditions, the palaeo-reconstruction improved our validation for the saline zone (5&thinsp;g/L&ndash;35&thinsp;g/L TDS). Also, under highly permeable conditions the marine transgression simulated with the palaeo-reconstruction led to a steeper fresh-salt interface compared to its steady-state equivalent, while low permeable clay layers allowed for the preservation of volumes of fresh groundwater. This shows that long-term transient simulations are needed when estimating present-day fresh-salt groundwater distribution in large deltas. The insights of this study are also applicable to other major deltaic areas, given the wide-range of lithological model scenarios used in this study and since many deltas also experienced a Holocene marine transgression.},
