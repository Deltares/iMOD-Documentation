The iMOD Viewer consist of a standalone 3D viewer and a QGIS plugin. 

* The iMOD 3D Viewer is a 3D viewer for grids and datasets. 
  It supports IDF files, UGRID files and Grb.disu files that contain an unstructured layered grid.  
  The 3D Viewer also supports viewing some non-grid objects like IPF files and Shapefiles.

* The iMOD QGIS plugin aids exploring 4D geospatial data in QGIS.  
  Its primary components are visualization of timeseries, 
  both at points as well as on an unstructured grid, 
  cross-section visualization, including borelogs, and
  connecting to the 3D Viewer.
