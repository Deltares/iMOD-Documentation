🌍 The 11th edition of our User Day was a success! Nearly 100 participants from
11 countries gathered in Delft on 20 November for the Deltares International
Hydrology Software Days. 

We thank our keynote speaker Chris Langevin for his insight in MODFLOW 6
developments. Frans Roelofsen and Joeri van Engelen shared developments and the
roadmap for iMOD Suite. 

🎉 We are proud to announce that we released iMOD Python 1.0. 

Sessions on the main stage covered topics such as: 
- The National Hydrological Model of Denmark (Raphael Schneider & Simon Stisen) 
- MODFLOW 6 parallel capabilities (Joost Delsman) and Flexible quadtree sub
  modelling (Jarno Verkaik) 
- Land Subsidence (Joe Hughes)   
- Groundwater Energy (GWE) Model for MAR systems (Arjan van Wachtendonk) 
- MODFLOW 6 Solver settings (Huite Bootsma) 

In the afternoon, participants enjoyed short pitches on interesting topics
related to our current developments and beyond, presented by Hendrik Kok, Robert
Leander, Sunny Titus, Davíd Brakenhoff, Jesse Reusen and Mart Clanor. Meanwhile,
others joined a parallel session for the iMOD Python hands-on training. 

🤝 It was fantastic to see so many professionals engage, collaborate, and help
strengthen the global hydrology community. We’re already looking forward to the
next edition in 2026!
