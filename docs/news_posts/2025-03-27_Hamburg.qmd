First iMOD User Day in Germany: A Huge Success! 🎉 

On Thursday, March 27th, the very first iMOD User Day in Germany was organized
by the Geological Survey of Schleswig-Holstein (Klaas Stoepker) and Hamburger
Wasser (Björn Stiller) and hosted in Hamburg. This event brought together
over 40 participants, including iMOD users from governments and consultants
across Schleswig-Holstein, Niedersachsen, Hessen, Hamburg and Bremen. What an
inspiring day it was! 🙌 

The packed agenda included: 
✅ Engaging iMOD cases from different Bundesländer focusing on groundwater modelling for research and policymaking 
✅ A deep dive into iMOD5's advanced functions 
✅ Insights into iMOD Suite's new developments and live demos 
✅ Lessons learned from the Dutch National Groundwater Program 
✅ A look ahead at future iMOD developments and user requirements 

Our Deltares delegation (Timo Kroon, Frans Roelofsen, Peter Vermeulen, Joeri
van Engelen and Bernhard Becker) shared insights, gave support, gave technical
demonstrations, and explained the developments in iMOD5 and iMOD Suite. 

💡 The take-home message from the event? MODFLOW6 is the foundation of all
models and the 3D viewer of iMOD5 is still widely used by the community.
Agreements for maintenance and support contracts were also established. The
overwhelming feedback from attendees? They voted unanimously for a two-day event
for the next iMOD User Day! 

Thank you to everyone who joined us and made this event so special. For

Looking forward to more great events in the future! 🌱
