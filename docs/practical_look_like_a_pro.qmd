These are some general tips and tricks to make your editors and
terminals look cool. They are not going to greatly improve your
workflow, but they will make things look cool and thus make your working
more enjoyful. Please do this in your own time.

## Powershell themes

There are themes available for Powershell which you can use to make your
boring terminal look cooler. These will also be used by Windows Terminal
and VSCode after some extra configuration.

branch, as well as which Spotify song I\'m currently listening to.

cool!](figures/practical/look_cool/cool_terminal.jpg)

### Step 1: Installing new fonts

All these cool extra icons like the play button and the folder symbol in
Figure 1 require extra icons not contained in your standard monotype
font. To unlock them, you have to install [\"Nerd
fonts\".](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)

In the following examples, I will use CascadiaCode NerdFont, which you
can download zipped [via this
link](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.1.0/CascadiaCode.zip)

Unzip its\' contents, and install [Caskaydia Cove Nerd Font Complete
Mono Windows Compatible.ttf]{.title-ref}, by right-clicking the file and
install for all users. You know it has to be good with such a long
filename!

### Step 2: Configure software to use Nerd Font

We first have to configure your editor/terminal to use the Nerd Font,
otherwise all the icons will be shown as ￿, which spoils the fun.

In Windows Terminal, press `CTRL+,` , which opens the Settings window.
Next, navigate to [Windows Powershell \> Appearance]{.title-ref}. And
under [Fonts]{.title-ref}, select [CaskaydiaCove NF]{.title-ref}, if you
installed the font I suggested.

In VSCode, also press `CTRL+,` to open the Settings window. Navigate to
[Text Editor \> Font]{.title-ref} and under [Font Family]{.title-ref}
type `CaskaydiaCove NF` in front.

In Powershell, you can right click window bar and navigate to
[Properties \> Font]{.title-ref} and under [Font]{.title-ref}, you can
select [CaskaydiaCove NF]{.title-ref}.

### Step 3: Install Git for Windows

If you want your themes to integrate with Git, you can install [Git for
Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads) .

I have not tested if the themes worked without Git for Windows, so I
recommend installing it.

[I also wrote a guide on how to use Git by the way.](practical_git_dvc.qmd)

### Step 4: Install themes for Powershell

Now open up a Powershell instance as administrator, and run the
following lines of code:

``` 
Install-Module posh-git -Scope CurrentUser
Install-Module oh-my-posh -Scope CurrentUser -RequiredVersion 2.0.412
Update-Module -Name oh-my-posh -AllowPrerelease -Scope CurrentUser
Install-Module -Name PSReadLine -Scope CurrentUser -Force -SkipPublisherCheck
```

This will probably throw you some warnings if you really want to install
this stuff, but let\'s [trust the good people at
Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/tutorials/powerline-setup).

### Step 5: Configure Powershell

Because we want Powershell to automatically use new cool themes, we will
configure our Powershell profile. Call `notepad $PROFILE` and paste the
following lines of text:

``` 
Import-Module posh-git
Import-Module oh-my-posh
Set-PoshPrompt -Theme cinnamon
```

If everything worked, if you open up a new Powershell terminal, it will
look like Figure 1. If you see any squares as `￿`, you have to check if
Step 2 went OK.

### Step 6: Being a unique individual

A cool person decides what is cool him/herself of course. To get a list
of all available themes, you can call `Get-PoshThemes`.

![Wowzers!](figures/practical/look_cool/Available_Themes.png)

This provide a nice demo reel of available themes.

If you find something you like, you can set it as your default theme by
repeating Step 5, and changing the last line, e.g.:
`Set-PoshPrompt -Theme powerline`.

### Bonus: Get a headache with retro effects

Windows Terminal has retro effects available. Again press `CTRL+,`, go
to [Windows Powershell \> Appearance]{.title-ref}. And click [Retro
terminal effects]{.title-ref}.

This will make your terminal more headache inducing:
