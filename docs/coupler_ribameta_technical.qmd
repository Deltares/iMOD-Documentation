The exchanges between kernels can be summerized as follows:
<ol>
<li value=1> Surface water levels (stages) for all MODFLOW6 cells with an active RIV coupling to produce an estimate of the active RIV flux.
These surface levels are obtained from a Ribasim subgrid water level profile by interpolation from the basin levels.
This interpolation requires the definition of a subgrid table within the Ribasim configuration. 
</li>
<li value=2> RIV flux (both active and passive) estimated by MODFLOW6, proposed to Ribasim</li>
<b>Ribasim-MetaSWAP sub-timestepping</b>
<ol>
<li value=3> Runoff (ponding) from MetaSWAP added to Ribasim</li>
<li value=4> Surface water sprinkling flux requested by MetaSWAP to be extracted from Ribasim, if allocated.</li>
<li value=5> Surface water sprinkling flux realized by Ribasim, reported back to MetaSWAP</li>
</ol>
<li value=6> RIV flux, realized by Ribasim, reported back to MODFLOW6</li>
<b>MODFLOW6-MetaSWAP iterations</b>
<ol>
<li value=7> Head of MODFLOW6 sent to MetaSWAP</li>
<li value=8> Storage coefficient from MetaSWAP sent to MODFLOW6</li>
<li value=9> Recharge from MetaSWAP sent to MODFLOW6 as a source term</li>
<li value=10> Groundwater sprinkling flux requested by MetaSWAP, extracted from MODFLOW6</li>
</ol>

## Some remarks
* Flows directly to or from Ribasim are communicated to the Ribasim kernel via the BMI variables <b>infiltration</b> for all extractions from and <b>drainage</b> for all additions to Ribasim basin volumes.  This requires a mapping to ribasim basins. 
However, amounts for infiltration and drainage are grouped and kept track off in an exchange object, rather than sent to Ribasim diretly.
The net effect of these contributions is sent to Ribasim just before solving Ribasim for the current timestep and individual contributions can also be logged.
* The surface water sprinkling is however kept separate as so-called 'user demands' applied to specific user-demand nodes in the Ribasim network. 
These demands are subject to an optimalization algorithm establishing allocation of water for all requests.
* Ribasim only couples to a River (RIV package ) for and Drainage (DRN) packages of
  MODFLOW6, no other packages of surface water boundaries should be active where Ribasim is coupled.
* One or more River and Drainage boundaries can be connected with one Ribasim basin. Inversely, more than one Ribasim basin couppled to a single MODFLOW6 boundary is *not* supported.
  

## Active versus passive coupling
In coupling Ribasim and MODFLOW6, a distinction exists between *active* and *passive* coupling.
In a passive coupling fluxes on the MODFLOW6 side are evaluated irrespective of the Ribasim waterlevels 
and contribute directly to the Ribasim basins. 
The Ribasim water levels are *not* required in this case, fluxes are simply regarded as "lateral" sources to the basin,
hence configuration on the Ribasim side is minimal.
The passive approach is justified for drainage packages showing little variation in terms of elevation over time (e.g. surface runoff, or ditches with negligible water depth).
On the contrary, in the case of an active coupling fluxes depend (linearly) on the Ribasim water levels.
This requires the stages in the MODFLOW6 model to be set to the subgrid water levels of Ribasim prior to evaluation of the river fluxes.

In the case of river packages "over-infiltration" can cause Ribasim water levels can fall to zero, leaving a dry basin.
Since in the passive situation, water levels are not taken into account, no feedback occurs that limits or impedes infiltration.
The MODFLOW6 model assumes infiltration to continue, whereas the coupled Ribasim basin already ran out of water. This raises a
discrepancy in the water balance between both models. Therefore, passive couplings are unsuitable for river packages
In active couplings, infiltration stops when the basin dries up and the water level reaches the bed elevation.

## Derivation of the realised sprinkling flux and the river flux correction.
Before performing a Ribasim update, the surface water sprinkling amounts in MetaSWAP and the active infiltration or drainage in 
MODFLOW6 have been evaluated under the assumption of an unlimited availability of surface water for these processes.
After Ribasims timestep, the *realized* extraction is known in Ribasim and this information must somehow be communicated to MODFLOW6 (step 6) and MetaSWAP (step 5) in order to maintain a correct overall water balance.

For the surface water sprinkling the following procedure is used to derive the realized fluxes for the MetaSWAP units.

* The realized fraction $f_i$ is derived of the realized sprinkling flux $R_i$, compared to the requested flux $D_i$ for Ribasim element $i$.
i.o.w.
$$
f_i\,=\,
\begin{align}
\begin{cases}
    R_i/D_i & D_i\neq 0 \\
    0 & D_i = 0
\end{cases}
\end{align}
$$

* The real contribution of Ribasim element $i$ to MetaSWAP element $j$ was then $f_i A_{ij} M^*_j$, where $M^*$ denotes the MetaSWAP vector of demand fluxes and $A_{ij}$ refers to an element of the couple matrix.

* So, the total realized flux $M_j$ received by MetaSWAP element $j$ is then obtained by summation over $j$: 
$$
M_j\,=\,\sum\limits_j f_i A_{ij} M^*_j 
$$\,\,,
or in vector notation for all MetaSWAP elements:
$$
\hspace{1cm}
\mathbf{M}\,=\,(A^T\mathbf{f})\odot\mathbf{M^*}
$$

The evaluation of the correction of the infiltration flux, for MODFLOW6 proceeds in a similar fashion, except:

* Not the realized fraction $f_i$, but its complement $1-f_i$ is used. 

* Correction is only applied to the *negative* demands. The positive demands, representing drainage, is unlimited.
$$
\begin{align}
M_j\,=\,
\begin{cases}
\sum\limits_j f_i A_{ij} M^*_j  & M^*_j<0 \\
\sum\limits_j M^*  & M^*_j>0
\end{cases}
\end{align}
$$

This must be taken into account into the realized fraction for the water balance to be correct:
$$

$$

In earlier implementation of coupling groundwater and surface water such corrections  were applied proportional  and applying 
This can be accomplished by evaluating the realized fractions on the Ribasim side and using the mapping to convert these fractions into 
fractions on the MetaSWAP or MODFLOW6 side: the reduction $\beta_i=R_i/D_i$ 
now applies to that portion of the demand by node/svat $j$ that is supposed to come from Ribasim element $j$  

The most straightforward way  
Let $R_{i}$ be the realized Ribasim infiltration amount for Ribasim element $i$ 
and $D_{j}$ the amount requested, $M_{j}$ the amount realized and $C_{j}$ the correction for element $j$ in the MetaSWAP or MODFLOW6 model.
